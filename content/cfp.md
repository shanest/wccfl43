## Note

WCCFL 43 will give preference to new work. For this reason, during the abstract submission process, authors will be asked to inform the Organizing Committee whether their work is under review for publication or has been submitted or accepted for presentation at a major conference. Authors should also notify the Organizing Committee promptly of any change in status of their submissions. (Note that this information will not be shared with reviewers.)
