The West Coast Conference on Formal Linguistics, or [WCCFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_Conference_on_Formal_Linguistics) (pronounced /ˈwɪkfəl/), is an annual linguistics conference, usually held in the spring at a university in western North America. Research presented at WCCFL can focus on any theoretical or formal aspect of natural language analysis, including phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics and pragmatics, and their interfaces.

WCCFL 43 will be hosted by the [University of Washington Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.washington.edu/).
